# How to use this template

There are two scenarios how you can use this template. First use the template option from GitHub. With this option you
will lose all history from this project and are not able to sync your changes in the future.

Alternatively you can follow
this [guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56577184/github-pull-changes-from-a-template-repository) to set a
separate upstream branch and pull changes in the future into your
repository.
